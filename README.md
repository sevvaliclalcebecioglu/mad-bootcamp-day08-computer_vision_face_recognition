## 🚀 Day 08 - Computer Vision Projects  
### Project from the "Mastering Applied Data Science Bootcamp"

This repository contains my study projects on **Computer Vision**, focusing on image processing, video analysis, and real-time vision applications using OpenCV and related libraries. The goal was to understand how computers interpret images and videos and to apply fundamental computer vision techniques in practical scenarios.

## 🔹 Project Overview  

The projects follow a structured workflow covering both image and video-based computer vision tasks:

### Image & Video Handling
- Read and display images using OpenCV  
- Capture live video from webcam and IP cameras  
- Save images and videos from real-time streams  

### Image Processing Basics
- Convert images to grayscale  
- Split and merge RGB channels  
- Resize, blur, and threshold images  
- Visualize pixel-level image data  

### Edge & Feature Detection
- Sobel edge detection (horizontal & vertical edges)  
- Laplacian edge detection  
- Canny edge detection  
- Blob detection for object-like structures  

### Real-Time Applications
- Live sketch effect using edge detection  
- Motion detection using frame differencing  
- Selfie capture from webcam  
- Object tracking and video playback  

### Face Detection & Recognition
- Face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers  
- Eye detection within detected face regions  
- Dataset creation for face recognition  
- Face recognition using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram)  
- Real-time face recognition with confidence scoring  

### Object Search & Template Matching
- “Where is Waldo?” project using template matching  
- Detecting a specific object/person in a crowded image

## 🔹 Key Results  

- Successfully processed images and videos using OpenCV  
- Implemented real-time webcam and IP camera applications  
- Detected edges and road-like structures using Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny  
- Built live sketch and motion detection systems  
- Detected faces and eyes in images and live video streams  
- Trained and tested a face recognition model using LBPH  
- Located specific objects within complex images using template matching

## 🔹 Conclusion  

These projects demonstrate the fundamentals of **Computer Vision**, from basic image manipulation to real-time face detection and recognition. By combining classical image processing techniques with OpenCV’s pre-trained models, it is possible to build efficient and practical vision-based applications. The work provides a strong foundation for more advanced topics such as deep learning–based object detection and autonomous systems.
